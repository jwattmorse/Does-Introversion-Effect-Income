# Does-Introversion-Effect-Income

This repository includes an econometric paper I coauthored with two other writers about the effects of invtroversion on income. Also included are the data appendix, STATA do files for both importing the data and running the regressions and some guidelines about the relevent data.


The data for the project came from the 2010 American Time Use Survey (ATUS). The relevent data can be found at the following link:
